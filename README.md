# Simple React Weather Widget

Component collection that displays high and low temperature for the next 5 days using the OpenWeather Map API

To run this small app locally, you will need node and npm installed globally on your machine. Clone down this repo and cd into its folder. You'll also need to create a new API key with the [OpenWeatherApi](https://openweathermap.org/price) and place it in your .env folder as a variable.

## Use-case:

Create an example of a simple weather widget that gets data from OpenWeather's [OneCallAPI](https://openweathermap.org/api/one-call-api) . This example shows one way to make a fetch call using loading states within a custom hook, and React's useReducer function.
